  <h1>
    LinkedIn API Auth Glitch
  </h1>

  <section style="color: #666; padding: 0 0.5rem 1rem">
    <p>
      This <a href="/">demo app</a> shows some unexpected behavior with the LinkedIn API
      auth system...
    </p>

    <p>
      After creating a new access token, the old token can "stick around" for
      up to 5 minutes (after the last call made with the old token), and
      <b>requests made with the new token will use the old token's permission
      scopes</b>.
    </p>

    <img src="./ghost-token.png" class="has-shadow" style="max-width: 90vw; margin: 1rem 0">

    <p>
      <b>This makes development difficult</b>. When a developer makes a change
      to the permission scopes (and reauthorizes), any API requests with the
      new token <i>might</i> use the old permissions (from a previous token)
      &mdash; if there was a request made with the old token in the past 5
      minutes. This makes it seem like their changes didn't make any
      difference. But then (after the 5 minute window passes) the new
      permissions will suddenly start working.
    </p>

    <p>
      This also creates <b>problems when upgrading the LinkedIn-Version</b>.
      If the new version requires a change in permissions, the user will need
      to reauthorize their account, but that could lead to a confusing
      situation where they get permission errors for up to 5 minutes, because
      the old token is still cached (and used) by the API. For example: in
      LinkedIn-Version <code>202305</code>, the minimum permission required
      for the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/shared/integrations/people/profile-api">/rest/me</a>
      endpoint was <code>r_liteprofile</code>, but starting with
      <code>202306</code> it needs to be <code>r_basicprofile</code>. So, we
      need to have our users reauthorize their LinkedIn account, to get a new
      access token with the new scope, but they could get permission errors
      from the old token, if it was used in the past 5 minutes.
